7
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:26,099
there is an area involved in visual

8
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,230
information processing called the visual cortex

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,890
imagine that you are riding a bicycle 
 皮质层想象你正骑着自行车

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,079
and in a certain distance you
然后看见距离你一定距离的

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,170
see a light switching from red to green

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,030
the information about the change of light color

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,039
will enter through your eye

15
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:47,878
now you have to decide whether you want to speed up

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:55,710
you continue just as normal

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,600
while you make your decision different areas of

24
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,290
of different brain errors is a rather
的描述是本课程的一个

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,469
cause description

26
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,259
in this class we will take a different approach 
在本课程中，我们将采用不同的方法

27
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,159
we will focus on one small cubic millimeter say of brain area

28
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,090
and this like little area of a cubic millimeter
就像这个块区域一样 约一立方毫米，

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,299
 you'll find 10,000 cells 
 你会发现10,000个细胞

30
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,688
or so and these cells form an integrated network 
和这些细胞形成一个网络

31
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:37,468
the cells involved in information 
这些在大脑中

32
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:39,180
processing in the brain are
 涉及到信息处理的细胞

33
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,569
called the neurons 
称为神经元

34
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,118
neurons have different parts 
神经元拥有不同的部分

35
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,328
there's a part called the dendrite

36
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:52,769
this is where information from other neurons will arrive
其他神经元的信息从这里到达

37
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:55,920
the soma is where the new one decides whether

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,259
it's going to send out a signal or not
它会发出信号或者不发出

39
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,560
and then this signal travels along the

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,858
axon to other neurons 
 轴突到其他神经元

41
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:10,770
each neuron makes contacts to thousands of other neurons
每个神经元与数以千计的其他神经元接触

42
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,840
the contact points are called the synapses
这些接触点称为突触(synapses)

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,490
 so the axon will branch out 
所以轴突(axon)将信号分散出来

44
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,150
and make different ramifications 
产生出不同的结果

45
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,449
and therefore we have not just the cells with a cell body

46
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,759
 but we have a lot of wire

52
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,340
how we did this kind of

53
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,939
drawing over 100 years ago

55
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:01,900
however only a glimpse

56
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,400
and it's still a simplification

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,099
because wherever you see empty space here

58
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,729
in fact there would be other cells

101
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,990
we just describe the action potential as

102
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,220
a pulse a standard pulse 
一个脉冲标准脉冲

103
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,459
so suppose a pulse arrives from a presynaptic neuron from a sending neuron 
所以假设脉冲来自发送神经元的突触前神经元

104
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,490
it arrives 
这个脉冲到达

105
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,610
it goes over the synapse 
越过了突触

106
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,420
and it causes a response on the postsynaptic side

107
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,699
on the side of the receiving neuron

108
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,939
the postsynaptic neuron is the neuron receiving the signal

109
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:55,860
that goes across

111
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,370
so this input pulse here will cause

112
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,939
this response over there 
此处的响应

113
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:09,000
now this new one will receive not just one input 
现在这里不仅会收到一个新的输入

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,250
but it will receive input pulses from many

115
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,370
different neurons 
的输入脉冲，

116
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,889
suppose many different pulses arrive 
假设许多不同脉冲到达

117
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,290
then the effects of all these different pulses will be added up
这些影响和全部不同的脉冲将被叠加起来

118
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,850
so this describes how different incoming
所以这描述了不同的输入

119
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,110
pulses are transformed into a response of the receiving cell t
脉冲转化为接收单元的响应

120
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,139
his response is

121
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,259
called the postsynaptic potential

123
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:40,259
this cell here decide but they will send

124
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,050
out a signal itself or not

125
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,350
now the formation of a pulse

126
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,860
is triggered in this model 
触发了一个脉冲

127
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,139
if this membrane potential

00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,319
if this postsynaptic potential reaches a value theta a threshold value

131
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,959
and afterwards we have some reset of the

132
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:06,189
membrane potential to a low value 
一个比较低的值静息电位

133
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:08,319
so this kind of model which are called

134
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,829
indicating fire model 
 IF模型

135
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:15,550
in this kind of models spikes are formal events
在这种模型中，峰值是正式时间

136
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,589
they are triggered at the moment

137
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,959
when the membrane potential crosses the threshold

138
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,110
and then a spike is sent out 
 然后发出一个尖峰

139
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,089
and after the spike there's some reset 
 然后尖峰会下降和上升

140
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:28,899
and refract on us a simple version of this model
这个模型的简单版本

141
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:31,990
will be the topic for today 
将是今天的主题

142
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,120
and it will come back to this model 
 回到这个模型

143
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,050
towards the end of this series of lectures  
 在这一系列课程结束时

144
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,329
suppose now we have this kind of model 
现在假设我们有这种模型

145
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,339
and our noon receives many many spikes from other

146
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,670
neurons to make things simple 
做一下假设来进行简化

147
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,029
we assume that spike arrival is random 
我们假设这个脉冲是随机的

148
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:56,439
as a result of this the potential will fluctuate as
因此，电位将作为时间的函数而改变
149
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,430
a function of time and only
仅仅与时间相关

150
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,600
occasionally a spike is send out 
只是偶尔发出一个尖峰，

151
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,550
so spikes are rather rare events trigger that a threshold
所以尖峰是一个触发到阈值产生的事件

152
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,649
below the threshold in the regime which
下面在政权阈值，其

153
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:14,350
is called sub threshold regime

154
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,540
what we observe and the random spike arrival is
我们观察脉冲随机到达

155
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,410
a fluctuating membrane potential and
一个波动的膜电位和

156
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,220
this is reminiscent of what one finds if

157
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,399
neural activity is recorded with an

158
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:30,970
electrode in an egg Mouse for example
 例如 ，鸡蛋中的电极

159
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,519
you see these fluctuations of the
你看到的这些波动

160
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,889
membrane potential and spikes are rare
 膜电位和尖峰非常稀少

161
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,440
events from time to time a spike is sent out 
 事件不时发送尖峰

162
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,049
so in lectures in week five and six
因此在第五周和第六周的讲座

163
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,240
the last questions what do these

164
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,409
fluctuations means is this noise what's

the neuron what is the neural code

168
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,879
so overall I will present this week a
